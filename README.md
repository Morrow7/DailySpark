📖 Introduction
DailySpark is an immersive English learning platform designed to simulate a 100% English-speaking environment. By leveraging advanced AI chatbots and a modern cross-platform architecture, it provides users with a seamless experience to practice reading, writing, and conversation in real-time contexts.
Goal: To break the barrier between "learning English" and "using English" through total immersion.
✨ Key Features
1. 🌍 Full English Immersion Environment
Zero Native Language Support: The interface, instructions, and interactions are strictly in English to force cognitive adaptation.
Context-Aware Learning: Content adapts to the user's proficiency level while maintaining an English-only context.
2. 🤖 AI Chatbot Companion
Real-time Conversation: An intelligent bot available 24/7 for text-based conversations on any topic.
Grammar & Style Correction: The bot subtly corrects mistakes during the chat and provides detailed feedback logs.
Role-Play Scenarios: Users can practice specific situations (e.g., job interviews, medical consultations, casual travel talks).
3. 📱 Cross-Platform Experience
Web Application: Built for desktop and mobile browsers with high performance.
Mobile App (React Native): A native mobile experience for learning on the go, syncing data seamlessly with the web version.
🛠 Tech Stack
We utilize a cutting-edge, type-safe full-stack architecture to ensure maintainability and high performance.
Frontend Framework
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on component reusability and state management.
TypeScript (TS): Ensures type safety across the entire codebase, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience.
Next.js: The React framework for production. Used for:
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO and fast initial loads.
API Routes for backend logic.
File-system based routing.
Styling & UI
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid UI development.
*(Note: Document references "twindcss" / Tailwind)*
Highly customizable design system ensuring a consistent look across Web and Mobile.
Mobile Development
React Native: Allows the use of React and TypeScript to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android, sharing business logic with the web app.
Architecture Philosophy
Given your background in Vue and DejaOS development, we have structured this project to be modular:
Component-Driven: Similar to Vue components, but leveraging React's lifecycle.
State Management: Planned integration with Context API or Redux Toolkit for global state (e.g., user progress, chat history).
